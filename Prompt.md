## AI Assistance Declaration (Minimal Guidance)

I used AI only for conceptual guidance and debugging support during this project.
The AI was not used to generate the complete project or write the full code.

### Prompts Used

1. "How should I connect a frontend HTML form with a Node.js backend using fetch API?"

2. "Where should the fetch POST request be placed when submitting form data from index.html?"

3. "What changes are required in server.js to handle POST requests from the frontend?"

4. "Why am I getting 'Cannot find package node-fetch' error and how to fix it?"

5. "Explain how to securely use an API key in a backend server instead of frontend."

### Usage Explanation

- AI helped me understand the correct flow between frontend and backend.
- I wrote and structured the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server logic myself.
- AI guidance was mainly used for error resolution and best practices.
- No complete files or final implementations were copied from AI responses.

This project reflects my own understanding and implementation of frontend–backend integration.
